# flavortown extension

just a quick extension to fix some lag and annoyances on flavortown.

## stuff it does

- **Snow Toggle**: turn off the snow particles if they are lagging your pc (check settings)
- **Performance**: blocks heavy analytics and hides massive bg images if you turn on "extreme mode"
- **Gallery -> Projects**: renames the gallery tab to projects because that makes more sense
- **Dedup**: fixes the bug where attachments show up twice in devlogs

## how to use

load it as an unpacked extension in chrome/edge/brave (developer mode) or temporary addon in firefox.

go to settings on flavortown and look for the new toggles at the bottom.
